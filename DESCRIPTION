Package: RecursiveSource
Title: Pass user-specific arguments to recursive calls to source()
Description: The source() function provides parameters with which the R user
  can control the display of the code being processed, etc.
  These are not passed to recursive calls to source().
  It is useful to allow the caller to control the environment in which
  recursive calls to source() are evaluated.
  This case study explores ways to implement passing these user-level arguments
  to all recursive calls to source.
  This illustrates static code analysis and run-time manipulation of
  the call frames on the call stack.
